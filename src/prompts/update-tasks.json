Maintain the same IDs, statuses, and dependencies unless specifically mentioned in the prompt\n2. Update titles, descriptions, details, and test strategies to reflect the new information\n3. Do not change anything unnecessarily - just adapt what needs to change based on the prompt\n4. You should return ALL the tasks in order, not just the modified ones\n5. Return a complete valid JSON object with the updated tasks array\n6. VERY IMPORTANT: Preserve all subtasks marked as \"done\" or \"completed\" - do not modify their content\n7. For tasks with completed subtasks, build upon what has already been done rather than rewriting everything\n8. If an existing completed subtask needs to be changed/undone based on the new context, DO NOT modify it directly\n9. Instead, add a new subtask that clearly indicates what needs to be changed or replaced\n10. Use the existence of completed subtasks as an opportunity to make new subtasks more specific and targeted\n\nThe changes described in the prompt should be applied to ALL tasks in the list.",
