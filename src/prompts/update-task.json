Research and update the description, details, and test strategy with current best practices\n4.

Return a complete valid JSON object representing the updated task\n6. VERY IMPORTANT: Preserve all subtasks marked as \"done\" or \"completed\" - do not modify their content\n7. For tasks with completed subtasks, build upon what has already been done rather than rewriting everything\n8. If an existing completed subtask needs to be changed/undone based on the new context, DO NOT modify it directly\n9. Instead, add a new subtask that clearly indicates what needs to be changed or replaced\n10. Use the existence of completed subtasks as an opportunity to make new subtasks more specific and targeted\n11. Ensure any new subtasks have unique IDs that don't conflict with existing ones\n12. CRITICAL: For subtask IDs, use ONLY numeric values (1, 2, 3, etc.) NOT strings (\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\n13. CRITICAL: Subtask IDs should start from 1 and increment sequentially (1, 2, 3...) - do NOT use parent task ID as prefix{{#if useResearch}}\n14. Include links to documentation or resources where helpful\n15.
